**Category:** OsinT   **Points:** 750  **Solves:** 31  **Description:**
*In a recent raid on a suspected COViD hideout, we found this video in a thumbdrive on-site. We are not sure what this video signifies but we suspect COViD's henchmen might be surveying a potential target site for a biological bomb. We believe that the attack may happen soon. We need your help to identify the water body in this video! This will be a starting point for us to do an area sweep of the vicinity!*

tldr: Searched for a pond near an airport and hdb flats
______

The most obvious thing in the video is a very loud sound that increases in volume and peaks the mic, which sounded like an airplane. So, the location can be approximated to be near either **Changi airport** or **Paya Lebar airbase**
Further inspection of the video also showed a **green-and-white hdb flat** near the water body.

This was a useful clue as when looking through google maps there are no HDB flats in the vicinity of Changi Airport.

*the nearest hdb from changi airport*



Thus, we can search google maps for water bodies near Paya Lebar airbase with HDB flats next to them. After looking at them, the only water body that fit the bill was Punggol park.

To confirm, further snooping around Punggol park found the brick-roofed house shown in the video

And finally, the bus stop shown in the video

Thus, we can confirm that the water body is indeed Punggol pond, thus the postal code, 538738 is the flag.
